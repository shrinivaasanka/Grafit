GRAFIT Open Learning - Free Online Course Material based on NeuronRain OpenSource Codebase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Free course materials which are based on NeuronRain OpenSource Codebase are committed in course_material/NeuronRain.

They have been segregated into:

(*) NeuronRain - Advanced Computer Science and Machine Learning (Graduate and Doctoral)

./NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt

(*) NeuronRain - Linux Kernel and Cloud (for students and Linux Kernel/Cloud professionals)

./NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/LinuxKernelAndCloud.txt

(*) NeuronRain - Cloud and Bigdata Analytics (for students and Cloud Data science professionals)

./NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/BigdataAnalyticsCloud_CourseNotes.txt

Generic Programming and Computer Science Miscellany course materials are in course_material/Programming and
course_material/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous:

(*) Programming - C/C++/Java/Python/GUI (for students and Professionals)

./Programming/Python/Python_CourseNotes.txt
./Programming/Java/Java_CourseNotes.txt
./Programming/C/C_CourseNotes.txt
./Programming/C++/CPlusPlus_CourseNotes.txt
./Programming/GUI/

(*) Miscellaneous Computer Science (Undergraduate Computer Science) 

./ComputerScienceMiscellaneous/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous_CourseNotes.txt

These will be updated periodically adapted for classroom teaching depending on feasibility of free courses.
These contain copyrighted materials - author's publications and yet to be published drafts on various computer science topics.

Pedagogy
------------------------------
Course notes in GRAFIT are non-linearly written than bottom-up or top-down textbook style of teaching. This is an
 experimental pedagogy based on following monte carlo simulation:
(*) Concepts/topics are vertices of a universal graph of concepts/topics. 
(*) By random sampling and exposition of concept vertices, related neighbouring concepts are also touched.
(*) Eventually high percentage of Topics in the Graph are traversed after lot of monte carlo sampling.
